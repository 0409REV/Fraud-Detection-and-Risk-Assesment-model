Problem Statement for Financial Fraud Detection Project
Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant losses due to fraudulent loan applications and suspicious transactions. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems often fail to catch sophisticated fraud patterns, leading to:

Approval of high-risk loans (leading to defaults).

Undetected fraudulent transactions (causing revenue loss).

Increased operational costs from manual reviews.

A data-driven fraud detection system is needed to:
âœ” Predict fraudulent loan applications before approval.
âœ” Flag suspicious transactions in real time.
âœ” Reduce false positives (legitimate transactions wrongly flagged).

Data Problem
We have two key datasets:

loan_applications.csv â€“ Contains loan application details with a fraud_flag.

transactions.csv â€“ Records customer transactions, including a fraud_flag.

Key Challenges:
ðŸ”¹ Imbalanced Data â€“ Fraud cases are rare (e.g., only 1-2% of transactions).
ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering â€“ Combining transactional behavior with loan application data.
ðŸ”¹ Model Interpretability â€“ Banks need to understand why a case was flagged.

Analytical Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Compare fraud vs. non-fraud cases in loans & transactions.

Identify high-risk demographics, transaction patterns, and merchant categories.

Feature Engineering

Merge datasets using customer_id.

Create new features like:

"Average Transaction Amount Before Loan Application"

"Number of High-Risk Transactions in Last 30 Days"

"Loan-to-Income Ratio"

Fraud Prediction Model

Train a binary classifier (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict fraud.

Optimize for precision (reduce false positives) and recall (catch more fraud).

Actionable Insights

Provide a risk score for each loan applicant.

Recommend real-time fraud alerts for suspicious transactions.

Expected Outcome
A machine learning model + dashboard that helps banks:
âœ… Automatically flag high-risk loan applications.
âœ… Detect fraudulent transactions in real time.
âœ… Reduce financial losses due to fraud.
