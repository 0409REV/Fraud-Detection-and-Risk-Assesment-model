Step-by-Step Explanation of the Financial Fraud Detection Code
This project aims to predict fraudulent loan applications by analyzing customer loan data and transaction history. Below is a breakdown of the key steps:

1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
âœ… Load Datasets:

loan_applications.csv (loan details + fraud_flag)

transactions.csv (customer transactions + fraud_flag)

âœ… Basic Checks:

.info() â†’ Check missing values & data types

.nunique() â†’ Unique values per column

Convert application_date & transaction_date to datetime

âœ… Handle Missing Data:

Fill missing fraud_type with "Not Fraudulent"

2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
A. Outlier Handling (Numerical Columns)
ðŸ“Œ Identify Numerical Columns:

loan_amount_requested, monthly_income, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Cap Outliers:

Clip values between 1st & 99th percentiles to reduce skewness.

ðŸ“Œ Visualization:

Before & after box plots to verify outlier treatment.

B. Feature Engineering
ðŸ”¹ Time-Based Features:

application_year, application_month, application_day_of_week

ðŸ”¹ Financial Ratios:

debt_to_income_ratio

loan_amount_to_income_ratio

ðŸ”¹ Merge Loan & Transaction Data:

Join on customer_id to link loan applications with past transactions.

ðŸ”¹ Aggregate Transaction Features:

For each loan application, compute:

Number of transactions (30d, 90d, 180d, 365d)

Total transaction amount

Average transaction amount

Unique merchant categories

3. Data Preprocessing
A. Train-Test Split (Stratified Sampling)
ðŸ“Œ Target: fraud_flag (binary classification)
ðŸ“Œ Split: 80% train, 20% test (stratified to maintain fraud ratio)

B. Feature Scaling & Encoding
ðŸ”¹ Numerical Features: Standardized using StandardScaler()
ðŸ”¹ Categorical Features: One-hot encoded (OneHotEncoder)

C. Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE)
ðŸ“Œ Problem: Fraud cases are rare (~1-2%) â†’ Model may ignore fraud.
ðŸ“Œ Solution: Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) to balance classes.

4. Model Training & Evaluation
A. Models Used
Logistic Regression (Baseline)

Random Forest (Feature Importance)

LightGBM (Best for Imbalanced Data)

B. Evaluation Metrics
ðŸ“Œ ROC-AUC Score (Measures modelâ€™s ability to distinguish fraud vs. non-fraud)
ðŸ“Œ Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
ðŸ“Œ Confusion Matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN)

C. Results Interpretation
LightGBM typically performs best due to handling imbalanced data well.

High Recall â†’ Catch more fraud (even if some false positives).

High Precision â†’ Fewer false alarms.

5. Loan Status Prediction (Multi-Class)
âœ… Target: loan_status (Approved, Declined, Fraudulent)
âœ… Handling Imbalance: SMOTE for multi-class
âœ… Model: LightGBM (Multi-Class Mode)
âœ… Evaluation:

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

6. Prediction on New Data
ðŸ”¹ Function: predict_loan_risk_and_fraud()

Takes new loan application data.

Applies the same preprocessing & feature engineering.

Predicts:

Fraud Probability (Logistic Regression)

Loan Status (LightGBM)

ðŸ”¹ Example Output:

python
Predicted Fraud Flag: 1 (Fraud)  
Fraud Probability: 0.92  
Predicted Loan Status: "Fraudulent"  
7. Business Impact & Recommendations
ðŸš€ Key Benefits:
âœ” Reduce fraud losses by flagging high-risk applications.
âœ” Improve approval accuracy by detecting fraud early.
âœ” Automate risk assessment using ML instead of manual reviews.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:

Deploy as a real-time fraud detection API.

Monitor model drift & retrain periodically.

Add geospatial features (e.g., transaction locations).

Final Thoughts
This project demonstrates a complete fraud detection pipeline, from EDA â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ ML Modeling â†’ Prediction. The LightGBM + SMOTE approach works best for imbalanced fraud detection.
